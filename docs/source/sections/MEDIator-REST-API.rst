MEDIator RESTful APIs
*********************

If you are hosting MedCurator for public access, you need to start it and expose its RESTful APIs. Execute the

$./run_api.sh

You may extend or leverage the exposed APIs.

To begin with, you may consume the MEDIator RESTful APIs through a REST client such as the Postman plugin of the Chrome browser.
