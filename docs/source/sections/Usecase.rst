The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) encourages and supports cancer-related open science communities by hosting and managing the data archive, and relevant resources to facilitate collaborative research. Hence, MEDIator has been primarily implemented with TCIA to begin with.
 
Also, local file system has been implemented.

If you want to add other data source, you can easily extend it. More details can be found in MEDIator for Developers.
