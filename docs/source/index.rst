MediCurator : Near Duplicate Detection for Medical Data Warehouse Construction
******************************************************************************

Welcome to the MediCurator Documentation.
Here you will find information describing the features of the MediCurator platform,
tips on how to use it, and details about its RESTful API.

With the growing adaptation of pervasive computing into medical domain and
increasingly open access to data, near duplicate detection algorithms have been
proposed and implemented in order to detect and eliminate duplicate entries from
massive datasets.

Traditionally, near duplicate detection algorithms are sequential and operate on
a single computer. Now, InMemory Data Grids (IMDG) offer a distributed storage
and execution, giving the illusion of a single large computer over multiple
computing nodes in a cluster. However, common distribution strategy and framework
to parallelize the execution of the near duplicate detection algorithms is still
lacking.

MediCurator is a near duplicate detection framework for heterogeneous medical data
sources in constructing data warehouses. MediCurator has been developed to retrieve
medical data from various data sources, including MySQL, MongoDB, CSV files, and
medical image archives such as TCIA, and detect the duplicates in-memory, while
storing the merged data into data warehouses hosted in Hadoop Distributed File
System (HDFS).

This documentation is intended to serve both the MediCurator developers/deployers
as well as the MediCurator users.
